# Payroll - Metamask App

You can use the current code version here: [Payroll-Metamask](https://payroll-metamask.herokuapp.com/).

## Personal Intro

My name is Nestor Barboza, and I am currently a freelance Web Developer. I have been working as a developer for the past three years. I have always been engaged in Technology/Computer Science since I have use of memory. 

I started from my early childhood to assemble and troubleshoot hardware, then learning how to get the most out of any software to finally writing my own code. Throughout my life, I’ve been fascinated with the quick and clever technologies that I’ve seen develop, since the early days of the internet, web, email going to what we have today, blockchain technology in particular has really catched my attention in the recent years, because I think it will have a profound impact on our future once it’s fully developed.

Aside from technology, of course, I have other things that I love, playing/watching sports, esports is one of my favorites, I love to compete and always give the best out of me in everything I do, swimming is one of my favorites sports activities and also I love to cook some tasty dishes.

## Description

This app let's you add invoices (as a Contractor) to your browser's LocalStorage and then use the Employer's Portal to pay the different invoices that were submitted, by using your metamask accounts.

### Running

After downloading the code and getting the modules you just need to: npm start, to run the app.

### Time-Frame

10 hours.

### Components
[Contractors](/src/containers/Contractors.tsx) - Simple component that handles every invoice that is going to be submitted to the app.  
[Employer](/src/containers/Employer.tsx) - Component that handles the payment of each invoice submitted by a contractor.
 

### Notes
This project is still in development, here are some things I would like to add in the future:

- User registration.
- Better design for the homepage with graphics and explanation of the app.
- Add a 'history' for paid invoices.
- Use another option different than localStorage to store the data.
